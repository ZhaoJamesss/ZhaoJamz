			My initial aim was to find some cartoon soundtracks and mix them with existing material. I wanted to present an interspersed narrative style through the edited and cut videos. And to enhance that style through sound. For example, I repeated the scene of the main character in a daze three times and interspersed them in three stories that occurred throughout the day. I also used the same background music for the daze. I think this can create a kind of protagonist in the daze constantly recalling the day's events, the more you think about the more irritable. I think this is a good effect. I used the music from the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon chase to express the development of the fast-paced city in the video. It was very interesting. Because it gives the viewer a sense of mismatch and harmony at the same time. I also chose this theme because I wanted to express my design philosophy through my own reassembled video. That's cool, right?

			Simplicity creates comfort. This quote is from a book on interior design I read in the library before I committed to this assignment. It had a very strong influence on my next thoughts about making icons. As soon as I started designing my first draft, I was able to keep the iconography very simple, but not so much that it lost its original meaning. That is, it wouldn't look abstract. Over the course of 45 drafts, I was constantly using the step-back method of thinking to achieve my goals. That is, how to make it simpler and keep their color scheme consistent and in line with their meaning. But in the process of updating, I felt the difficulty. Because some things were lost, for example, my theme is about memory, but how do I design love and drowning separately in a unified style. In my subsequent Illustrator studies, I got the idea to make them "boom boom", a word used to describe roundness, which was interesting. In the process of creating the palette, I associated the memories with warmth, even if I was sad, I would look back on it like a ray of sunshine that made me feel comfortable. So I used warmer orange, red, light red, and light orange. Although the colors are few, they are enough to express my thoughts. For the sound production, I chose to use my guitar to make a sound effect with only one track, because I wanted it to sound simpler. In the final design of the finished product, the respective icons and the respective sound effects all operate under the same elements.

			My first draft idea was to create an image from my dream world through Unity, that is, a path that would lead you through every image that looked strange but that I had experienced in my dreams. In the beginning, I found the hardest part of the process was to build my imaginary image out of a 3D model. Later I used a simple gray box model to roughly outline what I would be doing in each space. This was very difficult compared to constructing a two-dimensional space, because I also had to consider the visual interpolation relationships. Interestingly, I added a camera model with a first-person perspective, and this model represents the dream me to join the fun of this game measurement. I chose my favorite sound effects, such as the roar of the beast through the debugging into the shark monster, and the sound of chewing debugged into the sound of the campfire. And made them into a 3D surround effect, which can add more fun, and add more elements to my design. Interestingly enough, I was actually really proud of the 3D environment in my final playtest, because it was really great, and it was exactly the scene I wanted. I hope the users will also have the fun they think they will have after experiencing it.
